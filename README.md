# Learning Shaders

Hello and thank you for stopping by!
I am using this repository to learn about Shaders in Unity and HLSL.

I am doing it old style so no ShaderGraph or NodeBased editors. The reason is quite simple: I want to understand the underlying mechanisms for writing shaders and I really enjoy playing around with math and matrices, so writing code is still the best option.
